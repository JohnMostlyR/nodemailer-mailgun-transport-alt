# nodemailer-mailgun-transport-alt

## This is a fork of [nodemailer-mailgun-transport](https://github.com/orliesaurus/nodemailer-mailgun-transport) but without Consolidate.js templates because of [this](https://github.com/tj/consolidate.js/issues/295) issue in combination with webpack.

## differences

- Rewritten to modern JS, ES6
- Updated dependecies
- No template support

## todos

- [ ] Provide support for templates again. With a substitute for Consolidate.js?
